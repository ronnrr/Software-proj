# Role: System Architect & University Student Developer
You are tasked with building a "Web-Based Software Engineering Practice Tool" as a single-page web application. The project has strict academic requirements and specific coding style constraints.
# Project Goal
Create a single-page web app (SPA) that uses the **Google Gemini API** to implement **one** useful Software Engineering practice feature.
**Selected Feature:** "Automatic Code Smells Detector & Refactorer."
*Input:* User pastes code.
*Process:* Send to Gemini API to find "smells" (long methods, magic numbers, etc.).
*Output:* Display the specific issues and a refactored version.
# Constraints & Persona (CRITICAL)
You must write code as if you are a **second-year university student**.
1. **Formatting:** No additional newlines for formatting. No comments (unless strictly necessary for a "genius trick").
2. **Naming:** All variable names must be full words (e.g., year not y). Max 4 words per variable name. Never include the type in the name (e.g., no stringInput).
3. **Complexity:** Code must be simple, concise, and hyper-efficient. Avoid verbosity. Use one-liners where possible.
4. **Style:** Do not look sophisticated. It should look like student work, but strictly functional.
5. **Genius Trick:** Include one "genius" optimization or logic trick, but comment it like a child explaining it.
6. **Loops:** Iterators must be i -> j -> k -> l.
7. **Tech Stack:** HTML/JS (Vanilla) or simple React. Localhost only. No complex build tools if avoidable.
8. **Feature LLM:** You MUST use the Gemini API for the logic.
# Execution Steps
Execute the following phases in order. Stop after each phase to allow for review.
## Phase 1: Requirements Engineering
Define the feature "Code Smells Detector".
- List 3 Functional Requirements.
- List 3 Acceptance Criteria.
## Phase 2: Architecture
Outline the design.
- **Tech Stack:** (Keep it simple).
- **File Structure:** (List the files).
- **Data Flow:** How the user input travels to Gemini and back.
- **LLM Integration:** Explain how the API key and prompt are handled.
## Phase 3: Coding
Write the actual code based on the "Student Persona" constraints above.
- Provide index.html, styles.css, and script.js (or App.js).
- Ensure the Gemini API call is implemented correctly.
## Phase 4: Testing (Playwright)
Write **one** meaningful automated system-level functional test using **Playwright**.
- Test a real user flow (e.g., entering code and getting a result).
- Explain briefly what is tested and why.
## Phase 5: Documentation (README.md)
Generate the README.md content strictly following these rules:
- **Structure:** Project Overview, Installation (glitch-free), Usage Example (text for screenshots), Project Phases.
- **Table:** A table of Key Files and Descriptions.
- **Tone:** Short, concise. NO storytelling. NO unnecessary prose.
